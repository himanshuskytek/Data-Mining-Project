# Data-Mining-Project
 The bank is combatting rising credit card customer attrition by implementing a predictive model to identify potential churners. Through proactive engagement, personalized services, and enticing incentives, the bank endeavors to retain customers and reverse their decision to leave the credit card services.

 Also we have prepared a few business questions like:
1. What is the relationship between "Total Trans Ct" and "Total Trans Amt," and how does their interaction influence the likelihood of customer churn? 
2. How can the company use the information from the heat map to reduce customer churn?

We also recommended the categories of the customers to be target:
1. Clients with lower income
2. Clients with lack of formal education
3. Customers with a low ratio of average utilization
